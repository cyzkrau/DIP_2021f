## DIP: Digital Image Processing

Here is my homework codes git in USTC DIP course (ID: MATH6420P.01) in Autumn-Winter 2021. 

- Course Webpage: [Digital Image Processing](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~lgliu/Courses/DIP_2021_autumn-winter/default.htm)
- Teacher: [Prof. Dr. Ligang Liu](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~lgliu/)

There are 4 projects I wanna show:

- [Color Transfer](Color_Transfer)
- [Poisson Editing](Poisson_Editing)
- [Image Warping](Image_warping)
- [Lazy_Snapping](Lazy_Snapping)

Most of the code is based on numpy, opencv, matplotlib etc. in Python 3.8.10. 

In my homepage, there is a git with C++ or MATLAB codes in Computer Graphics. Some of topics are same.
